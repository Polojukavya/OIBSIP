                    <h3 class="para-heading">Early Life</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> was born in Porbandar, a town in Gujarat in western India family and faced discrimination and social inequality from a young age due to the caste system prevalent in India during that time. Despite these challenges, he pursued education vigorously and earned several degrees, including a doctorate in economics from the University of London.</p>

                    <h3 class="para-heading">Legal Career</h3>
                    <p> Gandhi was the leader of the nationalist movement against British rule using a non-violent approach. Gandhi was also a man of action, and was unique in acting at both political and personal levels. He led the greatest anti-colonial struggle in history, organised his deeply divided countrymen, gave them a sense of collective pride, forged tools of collective action that continue to stand India in good stead, and developed a unique method of struggle that combined the energy and effectiveness of violence with the peacefulness and humility of non-violence.</p>

                    <h3 class="para-heading">Philosopher</h3>
                    <p> Gandhiji's philosophy of life has four elements namely- (1) Truth, (2) Non-Violence (3) Fearlessness and (4) Satyagraha. Gandhiji philosophy of non-violence has great relevance in current scenario. Gandhian ideology emphasises not on idealism, but on practical idealism. Gandhian philosophy is a double-edged weapon. Its objective is to transform the individual and society simultaneously, in accordance with the principles of truth and non-violence. </p>

                    <h3 class="para-heading"> Freedom Fighter </h3>
                    <p> As a freedom fighter, Gandhi was a man of firm conviction. During his freedom struggle, the British had put him in jail several times, where he endured extreme hardships. To honour his role in the freedom struggle, his birthday is observed as a national holiday to pay homage to him and all others who stood with him.</p>

                    <p> Gandhiji's vision and philosophy are pillars of the work of the United Nations. Part of his genius lay in his ability to see the inter-connectedness and the unity between all things. His political achievements included leading the movement that ended colonial rule in India, using peace, love and integrity to prevail. </p>
